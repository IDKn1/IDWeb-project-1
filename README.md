## What is it
This website is for a design agency, and supports both mobile and computer screen sizes. Like we had discussed i want to focus on a single webpage desing instead of a multipage one. Given the styling i picked for the past cilents section i felt that focusing on closer to a newspaper style would be more fitting so i started with a big hero image and made use of grids through out for the responsieve portions of the rest of the website throughout. The only exception to this is the hover images in the past work section as i felt having them break this grid system made them both stand out more and also allowed for more fine tuning in making sure they were still visable but allowing the rest of the other items to be seen in mobile view
## Web componentent
- nav bar with mobile version
- menu of past clients with portions for clients that couldn't be diclosed and project image that shows on hover for both web and tap for mobile
- contact form that would have feedback for wrong inputs
