# A Single-Page Experience: The Agency Portfolio
## Overview
This website is designed for a design agency and is optimized for both mobile and desktop screens. As discussed, I decided to focus on a single-page layout instead of a multi-page design. For the "Past Clients" section, I felt that adopting a newspaper-style aesthetic would be more appropriate. I started with a hero image and incorporated a grid layout throughout the responsive sections of the site. The only exception is the hover images in the "Past Work" section, where breaking the grid allows them to stand out and provides more flexibility in ensuring visibility while maintaining a cohesive mobile experience.

## Web Components
- Navigation Bar: Includes a mobile-friendly version.
- Past Clients Menu: Features sections for undisclosed clients, with project images that appear on hover for desktop and tap for mobile.
- Contact Form: Designed to provide feedback for invalid inputs.

## Site Map
The site consists of a single main page.
